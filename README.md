All input data is produced from raw *fastq* files using QIIME2 v. 2019.10 with the q2-DADA2 plugin to infer ASVs. See Additional file 2 for the script.<br> 
Fastq files with raw sequence data are available from EMBL EBI project PRJEB51018.<br>
Figures produced in R have been edited with Adobe Illustrator into final formatting styles.<br>
